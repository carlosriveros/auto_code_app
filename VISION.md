# Mobile App Building Studio - Full Vision

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Web app code generation with Claude AI
- ‚úÖ Basic project management
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment
- ‚úÖ PWA for mobile-first experience
- ‚úÖ Chat-based interface

## Vision: "Code Anywhere" Studio
Build production-ready web and mobile apps from your phone while on the bus or toilet.

---

## Core Philosophy
1. **Mobile-first everything** - Every feature must work perfectly on a phone
2. **AI as your pair programmer** - Natural language to code
3. **Zero local setup** - Everything in the cloud
4. **Deploy in minutes** - From idea to live app instantly
5. **Full-stack by default** - Frontend, backend, database, deployment

---

## Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: PWA Foundation (CURRENT - 4-6 weeks)
**Status**: In Progress

**What**:
- ‚úÖ PWA installation and offline support
- ‚úÖ Bottom navigation
- ‚úÖ Mobile-optimized chat interface
- üîÑ App icons generation

- RESTful API + GraphQL generation
- Authentication/authorization scaffolding
- Deploy backends to Railway/Render/Fly.io
- Environment management

**Example Use Case**: "Create a dating coach API with user profiles, chat, and content library"

**Why**: Can't build real apps with just frontend

---
