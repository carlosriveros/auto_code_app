- Web manifest and service worker
- Install prompts for iOS/Android
- Basic offline caching
- Bottom navigation redesign

### Sprint 3-4: Backend Generation Alpha (2 weeks)
- Detect backend code from Claude
- Basic Node.js/Express backend generation
- Railway deployment for backends
- Database provisioning (PostgreSQL)

### Sprint 5-6: Mobile UX Polish (2 weeks)
- Swipe gestures
- Pull-to-refresh
- Smooth animations
- Touch optimizations
- Status bar integration

### Sprint 7-8: Backend Generation Beta (2 weeks)
- Multiple backend frameworks
- Authentication generation
- API endpoint generation
- Environment variable management

### Sprint 9+: Advanced Features (Ongoing)
- Incremental improvements
- User feedback implementation
- Enterprise features

## 🎨 Use Case: Dating Coach App

**Example use case to drive development:**

Build an AI-powered dating coach iOS app with:
- FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL
- User authentication (JWT)
- Content library with dating advice
- AI chat using Claude API
- Semantic search over content
- Subscription/payment with Stripe
- PWA frontend optimized for iOS

**How the tool would work:**

1. User sends prompt: "Create a dating coach app with FastAPI backend, user auth, content library, and AI chat"
2. Claude generates:
   - FastAPI backend code (routes, models, auth)
   - Database schema
   - Claude API integration
   - React/Next.js frontend
   - PWA configuration
3. Tool automatically:
   - Provisions PostgreSQL on Railway
   - Deploys backend to Railway
   - Deploys frontend to Vercel
   - Configures environment variables
   - Connects everything together
4. User gets:
   - Backend URL
   - Frontend URL (installable as PWA)
   - Working app ready to use
